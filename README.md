Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Machine Learning on MRI Longitudinal Dataset
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting Alzheimer's Disease using longitudinal MRI data. The project focuses on developing models that can analyze changes in brain structures over time to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer's Disease progression.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of longitudinal MRI scans of individuals with and without Alzheimer's Disease. Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the dataset used in this project is not included in this repository. However, instructions for obtaining the dataset and preprocessing steps are provided in the `data/` directory.
This project focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms for the detection of Alzheimer's Disease using MRI longitudinal dataset. Four different algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, were employed to analyze the data and predict the presence of Alzheimer's Disease.
